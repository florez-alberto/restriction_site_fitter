TD2 : Tools and Methods for Cloning
You want to assess if an equivalent of the human gene HAT-gme exists in Mouse. The
HAT-gme human protein has a Histone Acetyltransferase or Histone Acetylase activity
(HAT1). The sequence of the human gene is fully known. The HAT1-gme protein acetylates
histones H2A and H4 on lysine residues at their N-terminus part.
1) Which preliminary experiment(s) would indicate the possible existence of this gene in
Mouse?
The experiment proved successful: you identified the existence of a human HAT1-gme
homolog in Mouse.
2) You want to clone and sequence the murine HAT-gme cDNA.
Which strategy will you use for this? Indicate the different experimental steps you go through.
Which characteristics should your cloning vector(s) have knowing that you aim at expression
of this gene in eukaryotic cells?
3) You now know the sequence of the Mouse HAT1-gme cDNA. This sequence is shown
below (5Та 3Т) with start and stop codons in bold. You want to proceed with overexpression
of this protein in order to study its sub-cellular localisation, identify its interacting protein
partners and intracellular targets.
Indicate the main features of the vectors you could use to answer to do these experiments.
You want to clone this gene in the pCDNA3.1 vector which carries 2 TAG sequences: His in
N-ter and FLAG in C-ter. Design 2 primers of 20 nt that you would use to amplify the HAT1-
gme cDNA by PCR. Introduce in each sequence a restriction site in order to clone it in the
proper Open Reading Frame (ORF) and right orientation.
Remarks :
- No restriction site of the MCS is found in the sequence to clone.
- The His and FLAG sequences have to be linked to the N and C ter of the HAT1 protein
